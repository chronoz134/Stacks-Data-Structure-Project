# Stacks-Data-Structure-Project
Project for implementing stacks using a static array.

This project was done for a class called data structures (CIS277).
Mainly the implementation of a stack with the functions pop, push, top, and purge.

Like many stacks pop would remove the last item placed into the stack and display it on the output for the user to see.
The push would push elements onto the stack making it the new top position.
Top would simply print out the last item placed into the stack.
Purge would empty the stack.

This was done as per guidelines of the assignment in which case it was completed using a static array and a pointer to manage the current top/position of the stack.
